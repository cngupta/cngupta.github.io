I am currently a **Postdoctoral Scientist** at the **Universiy of Wisconsin**, Madison, USA. As a computational biologist, 
my objective is to develop open-source frameworks for genomic data analysis. I am interested in developing  **predictive machine learning models** and platforms to enable wet lab scientists design effective downstream experiments. A recent example is  [GRAiN](http://rrn.uark.edu/shiny/apps/GRAiN/){:target="_blank"}.


**Network Biology**<br>
The foundation of my research philosophy is based on the fact that genes do not work in isolation; 
they function in networks comprising of multiple genes that partner to achieve a common cellular goal. 
I believe that the cornerstone of future crop improvement programs and precision healthcare is 
identifying **network communities that are activated by external environmental cues, such as occurrence of stress or disease**. 
With quickly evolving genomic technologies that allow data generation at unprecedented levels, I am enthusiastic about the 
potential of **data-driven** computational approaches for generating reliable targets for downstream experimentation and decision making, 
for example **genetic engineering** of desired crop traits, or identification of reliable **diagnostic markers**. 

I am currently working on a number of exciting projects in computational neuroscience.

My previous projects include 1) Transcriptome-based **gene networks** for systems-level analysis of 
gene function, 2) Optimization of pipelines to predict high-quality **SNVs and InDels from tumor sequencing data**, and
3) Methods to **integrate GWAS** with coexpression networks. [Read more....](https://cngupta.github.io/portfolio/)
