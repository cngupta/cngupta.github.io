The foundation of my research philosophy is based on the fact that genes do not work in isolation; 
they function in networks comprising of multiple genes that partner to achieve a common cellular goal. 
I believe that the cornerstone of future crop improvement programs and precision healthcare is 
identifying **network communities that are activated by external environmental cues, such as occurrence of stress or disease**. 
With quickly evolving genomic technologies that allow data generation at unprecedented levels, I am enthusiastic about the 
potential of **data-driven** computational approaches for generating reliable targets for downstream experimentation and decision making, 
for example **genetic engineering** of desired crop traits, or identification of **diagnostic markers**. 


I am currently a postdoctoral scientist at the Universiy of Arkansas, USA. As a plant computational biologist, 
my objective is to develop methods for integrating the vast amounts of continuously accumulating high-throughput -omics data, 
for the purposes of developing predictive machine learning models and platforms that will enable wet lab scientists 
design effective downstream experiments. A recent example is the [DroughtApp](http://rrn.uark.edu/shiny/apps/rrn/){:target="_blank"}.


My previous projects include 1) Transcriptome-based gene networks for systems-level analysis of 
gene function, 2) Optimization of pipelines to predict high-quality SNVs and InDels from tumor sequencing data, and
3) Methods to integrate GWAS with coexpression networks.
