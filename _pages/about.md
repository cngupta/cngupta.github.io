I am a computational biologist in the [Dept. of Crop, Soil and Environmental Sciences](https://crop-soil-environmental-sciences.uark.edu/) at the [Universiy of Arkansas](https://www.uark.edu/) working on functional impacts of genetic variation in rice, gene interaction networks and methods to integrate heterogenous genomic data. My most recent project is development of the [StressApp](http://rrn.uark.edu/shiny/apps/rrn/).

I received a **MS in bioinformatics** in 2009 from the Sardar Patel University, India, and a **PhD in cell and molecular biology** in 2017, from the University of Arkansas, Fayetteville, USA.

The foundation of my research philosophy is the belief that genes in living cells do not work in isolation; they function as networks of multiple genes that play a role in reaching a desired cellular/metabolic state. Identifying which **network communities are activated in response to stress or occurrence of disease**, is the most important goal of future crop improvement programs. With vast amounts of genomic data becoming increasingly available, I am enthusiastic about the value of data-driven computational genomic approaches for exploring the potential of generating reliable targets for **genetic engineering** of agricultural crop traits**.
