Chirag Gupta is a postdoctoral scientist in the [Department of Crop, Soil and Environmental Sciences](https://crop-soil-environmental-sciences.uark.edu/) at the [Universiy of Arkansas](https://www.uark.edu/); research in computational biology; developer of [StressApp](http://rrn.uark.edu/shiny/apps/rrn/) and [RECoN](https://plantstress-pereira.uark.edu/RECoN/).

Chirag received a **MS in bioinformatics** in 2009 from the Sardar Patel University, India, and a **PhD in cell and molecular biology** in 2017, from the University of Arkansas, Fayetteville, USA; his PhD advisor was Andy Pereira, who continues to advise him through his postdoctoral training.

Chirag is a **computational biologist** focusing on problems in **crop genetics and genomics** - particularly the analysis of **gene networks and metabolic pathways** dysregulated during environmental stresses such as drought and high temperature. Genes do not work in isolation, in fact, they function in groups, with each group working as a community to reach a common cellular goal. Identifying which **gene communities are activated in response to stress or occurrence of disease**, is the most important goal of present-day crop improvement programs. He is enthusiastic about the value of data-driven computational genomic approaches for exploring the potential of generating reliable targets for **genetic engineering in crops**.
