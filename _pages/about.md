I am a computational biologist at the [Dept. of Crop, Soil and Environmental Sciences](https://crop-soil-environmental-sciences.uark.edu/){:target="_blank"}, Universiy of Arkansas, working on functional impacts of genetic variation in crops, gene interaction networks and methods to integrate heterogenous agri-genomics data. I recently developed the [StressApp](http://rrn.uark.edu/shiny/apps/rrn/){:target="_blank"} for rice systems biology research.

I received **MS in bioinformatics** in 2009 from the Sardar Patel University, India, and **PhD in cell and molecular biology** in 2017, from the University of Arkansas, Fayetteville, USA. My advisor was [Andy Pereira](https://crop-soil-environmental-sciences.uark.edu/people/faculty-directory/uid/apereira/name/Andy+Pereira/){:target="_blank"}. 

The foundation of my research philosophy is based on the fact that genes in living cells do not work in isolation; they function in networks comprising of multiple genes with common cellular role. I believe that the cornerstone of future crop improvement programs is identifying **stress or disease activated communities in the gene interaction network**. With vast amounts of agrigenomic data becoming increasingly available, I am enthusiastic about the potential of **data-driven** computational approaches for generating reliable targets for **genetic engineering** of desired crop traits.
