I am currently a **Postdoctoral Scientist** at the **Universiy of Wisconsin**, Madison, USA. As a computational biologist, my objective is to develop computational pipelines and frameworks for multimodal biological data analysis. I apply  machine learning and AI tools to identify genetic factors associated with human diseases and agricultural traits in crop species.  

**Network Biology**<br>
The foundation of my research philosophy is based on the fact that genes do not work in isolation;
they function in complex networks comprising of multiple genes that interconnect with each other. Representing the functional relationships between genes as networks allows for efficient mining of key gene communities. A recent example is  [GRAiN](http://rrn.uark.edu/shiny/apps/GRAiN/){:target="_blank"}, built for mining genes involved in regulation of stress response in rice.

**Multimodal data integration**
With quickly evolving technologies that allow genomic, imaging and behavioural data acquisition and storage, I am enthusiastic about the potential of **data-driven** approaches that empower scientists to identify relevant biomarkers which can be effectively integrated into the decision making process by doctors, pharmaceutical companies and healthcare providers.

I am currently working on an exciting project in neuroscience.

My previous projects include 1) Transcriptome-based **gene networks** for systems-level analysis of
gene function, 2) Optimization of pipelines to predict high-quality **SNVs and InDels from tumor sequencing data**, and
3) Methods to **integrate GWAS** with coexpression networks. [Read more....](https://cngupta.github.io/portfolio/)
