Coexpression networks help overcome the limitations of sparsity in gene functional annotations, by providing a means to transfer knowledge from annotated genes to genes yet unannotated, based on the 'guilt-by association' assumptions. RECoN is designed to identify clusters of functionally genes that tightly coexpress in a compendium of abiotic-stress gene expression experiments in rice.
