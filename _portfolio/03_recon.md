Coexpression networks help overcome the limitations of sparsity in gene functional annotations, by providing a means to transfer knowledge from annotated genes to genes yet unannotated, based on the 'guilt-by association' assumptions. 
[RECoN](https://plantstress-pereira.uark.edu/RECoN/){: .btn .btn-outline} and [SANe](https://plantstress-pereira.uark.edu/SANe/){: .btn .btn-outline} are designed to identify clusters of functionally genes that tightly coexpress in a compendium of abiotic-stress gene expression experiments in rice and seed development stages in Arabidopsis, respectively. Both these tools allow users to upload and analyze results from relevant RNA-seq experiments in context of the underlying networks.
