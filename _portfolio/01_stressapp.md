[StressApp](http://rrn.uark.edu/shiny/apps/rrn/){: .btn .btn-outline} is a R/Shiny based app that uses machine learning to predict Transcription Factors that likely regulate abiotic stress responses. Initial nested cross-validation tests showed high accuracy in predicting known drought genes, while revealing some interesting characteristics of drought response in plants. Manuscript under development.
