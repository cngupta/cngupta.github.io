	<p>Chirag Gupta is a postdoctoral scientist in the Department of Crop, Soil and Environmental Sciences at the Universiy of Arkansas; research in computational biology; developer of StressApp and RECoN</p>
	<p>Chirag received a MS in bioinformatics in 2007, from the Sardar Patel University, India, and a PhD in computational biology in 2017, from the University of Arkansas, Fayetteville; his PhD advisor was Andy Pereira, who continues to advise him through his postdoctoral training.</p>
	<p>Chirag is a computational biologist focusing on problems in crop genetics and genomics - particularly the analysis of gene networks and metabolic pathways dysregulated during environmental stresses such as drought and high temperature. Genes do not work in isolation, in fact, they function in groups, with each group working as a community to reach a common cellular goal. Identifying which gene communities are activated in response to stress or occurrence of disease, is the most important goal of present-day crop improvement programs. He is enthusiastic about the value of data-driven computational genomic approaches for exploring the potential of generating reliable targets for genetic engineering in crops</p>
